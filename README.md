## Extra Credit (Peer-Review)

The peer review happened with conversations throughout the past week, and we met on March 1st to discuss details on implementation-specific information.

I was given the following feedback:
1. The CROSSWALK needs to be repeated for 10 seconds
    - DONE
2. The UART was not working appropriately
    - Added the correct logs and log files.
3. The main outline for the state machine was not clear.
    - went back over the state machine figure and made it more detailed.
